Blight
======

Blight is a Markdown-powered static blogging engine.


## Installation

Copy the `Blight.phar` file alongside your web directory. Then, copy the `index.php` file to the location you want the blog to be accessible on your site. Edit the `index.php` file ensuring the path in the `require()` line points to the `Blight.phar` file. Visiting the `index.php` page will walk through setting up the rest of the site.

After installation, your directory structure should look like the following:

	config.json

	Blight.phar
	
	blog-data/
		drafts/
			_publish/
		pages/
		posts/
		templates/
		plugins/
	
	www/
		.htaccess
		index.php
		
The paths to these directories are stored in the `config.json` file, so to change the directory structure, simply update this file.


## Authoring

New posts should be added to the `drafts/` or `posts/` directories. The filename will become the post's URL slug, so for example a post with the file `test-post.md` will become `2013/02/test-post`.

A new post should be formatted as follows:

	Post Title
	==========
	Header:	Value
	
	Content
	
The title and content are standard Markdown. The headers section under the title allows you to set a number of options and metadata for your post MultiMarkdown-style. Parameters are case-insensitive.

### Drafts

Posts saved to the `drafts/` directory will have preview HTML pages generated, but will not be listed on the site itself.

When drafts are ready to be published, add a line `Publish Now` to the header block, and the post will be moved to the published posts directory and added to the site on next rebuild. Alternatively, move the post to the `_publish/` directory in the drafts directory, and it will be published on rebuild.

### Pages

Simple pages in the same format as posts can be saved to the `pages/` directory, and will have a separate page generated in the public site area, but will not be listed along with posts.


### Special Headers

- **Date**: The publication date of the post. The time portion is optional but recommended.

	`Date: 2013-01-01 12:00:00`

- **Link**: Allows you to create linked posts, where the main link for the article in both the article lists and RSS feed links to the URL provided, while the permalink links to the post itself.

	`Link: http://www.example.com/`

- **Tags**: A comma-separated list of tags to group the post under. Tags should be written in a human-readable format, as URL-friendly versions will be generated automatically.

	`Tags: Example Tag, Other Tag`

- **Category**: A category to group the post under. Similar to _tags_, it should be written in a human-readable format, as a URL-friendly versions will be generated automatically.

	`Category: General`

- **RSS Only**: Only display the post in RSS feeds. It will not appear on any rendered HTML files, but will still have a standalone post HTML file generated.

	`RSS Only`


### Publishing

Loading the `index.php` file causes the site to be rebuilt. Once the site is built, however, the generated home page will override requests to the index file.

The simplest way to reload the site is to manually enter `index.php` into your address bar.

Alternatively, deleting the entire `{www}/_blogs/` directory will cause home page requests to again go through the PHP file.

A site rebuild can also be triggered from the command line, by navigating to the directory the system is installed to, and running the command `php Blight.phar`. The optional flag `-v` outputs additional information as the site is built.

Once the pages are built, the page will automatically reload showing the generated static home page. Rebuilding the site should take only a few seconds.


### Updating

When published, original post Markdown files will be organised into date folders, such as `posts/2013/02/2013-02-02-post.md`. To make changes to a previous post, just locate the post in these date folders, make any changes, and trigger a rebuild of the site.


## Templates

Templates are written using [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org), or alternatively can be written in regular PHP, and are contained in the `blog-data/templates/` directory. All templates must exist for the site to generate correctly.

The following variables are available to both PHP and Twig templates:

- **$blog**: An instance of the Blog class, providing access to site-wide URLs and other config settings.
- **$text**: An instance of the TextProcessor class, for converting raw posts to Markdown, etc
- **$archives**: An array of the years posts exist for

Twig templates have the following filters available:

- **md**: Converts the provided Markdown text into HTML
- **typo**: Performs a number of typographical enhancements on the provided text, such as converting quotes to curly quotes
- **truncate**(length = 100, ending = '...'): Truncates the provided HTML to a certain length.

Specific templates exist for individual pages, and have specific variables available to them:

### List

The **list** template handles pages with a collection of posts, excluding the home page. Archive pages for each year, pages for each tag, and pages for each category are generated using this template.

The following variables are available to list pages:

- **$posts**: An array containing posts for the current page

For each of the different listing types, the page's `Collection` object itself will also be provided:

- Year archive pages: **$year**
- Tag pages: **$tag**
- Collection pages: **$collection**

Additionally, if pagination is enabled in the `config.ini` file, the following variables are available:

- **$pagination**: A `Pagination` instance. If this parameter is not set, pagination is disabled

### Post

The **post** template displays individual posts on separate pages, where their permalinks will point to.

The following variables are available to post pages:

- **$post**: The Post instance for the current page
- **$post_prev**: The previous/older post neighboring the current post, useful for adding next/prev post links. This value may not always be set.
- **$post_next**: The next/newer post neighboring the current post. This value may not always be set.

### Page

The **page** template displays individual pages

The following variables are available to page-pages:

- **$page**: The Page instance for the current page
